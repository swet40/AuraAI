Tell me 5 interesting facts about bees
1. Bees are responsible for one-third of the food we eat.  They pollinate a vast array of fruits, vegetables, and nuts.  Without them, our diets would be significantly less diverse and more expensive.

2. A honeybee can fly up to six miles, and as fast as 15 miles per hour.  While they typically stay within a two-mile radius of their hive, they'll travel further if necessary to find good sources of nectar and pollen.

3. The queen bee can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. That's more than her own body weight! This prodigious egg-laying is essential for maintaining the hive's population.

4. Bees communicate through a complex "dance language."  By performing specific movements, a forager bee can tell other bees the distance, direction, and quality of a food source.

5. Honeybees are naturally hygienic. They meticulously clean the hive and remove any dead or diseased larvae to prevent the spread of infection. This behavior is crucial for the colony's survival.
