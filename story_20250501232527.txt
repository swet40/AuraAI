give three important characteristics of butterflies
Three important characteristics of butterflies are:

1. Metamorphosis: Butterflies undergo a complete metamorphosis, meaning they transition through four distinct life stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). This dramatic transformation is crucial for their survival and allows them to exploit different resources at each stage.
2. Scale-covered wings: Butterfly wings are covered in thousands of tiny, overlapping scales, which give them their vibrant colors and patterns. These scales are essential for flight, thermoregulation, and mate attraction. They also provide some protection from predators.
3. Proboscis: Butterflies have a long, coiled tube-like mouthpart called a proboscis, which they use to drink nectar from flowers.  This specialized feeding apparatus allows them to access a valuable food source and plays a vital role in polination
